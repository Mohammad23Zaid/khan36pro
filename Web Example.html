    <h2> Scope of Employement </h2>
</div>

<p>

The actions or activities an employee might reasonably undertake as part of his or her job. An employer is responsible for actions an employee takes within the scope of employment <br>
 which means the employer can be liable to third parties who are injured by the employee's conduct. For example, an employer would be liable for harm to a pedestrian caused by its delivery driver while driving a route; <br> the employer most likely would not be liable for harm the same driver caused if he or she hit a pedestrian while using the delivery van as the getaway car in a bank robbery.

<h2 Align="Center"><font color="blue"> Computer library </font> </h2>

<p>
    roles of library technicians and assistants have changed dramatically in the past twenty years as computers have transformed every area of day-to-day library operations.<br> 
    And nowhere have those changes been more obvious than when dealing with online data that hasn’t undergone the same quality control and selection processes traditionally used with library resources. <br> 
    As ordering and cataloging processes have been streamlined, and reference and research services have been turned into twenty-four hour help centers, Computers in Libraries is a practical guide to keeping pace with the changes you face—every day, in every aspect of your work.</p><br>
